        -        Forward fixes from WAF or USKP were needed, most from WAF except because it also has stat changes. USKP fixes were forwarded
                where it made sense like object bounds and description fixes
        -        Forward Fixes from USKP that conflict with Waterbreathing Breathless Emerge on 'Dialog Topic', added Agronian fixes from USKP

STEP: Extended Patch

        -        Nov. 26 Update:        Now compatible with Weapon and Armor Fixes 4.0, minimal changes were needed.
        -        Everything from STEP: CORE Patch carried over

        -        Resolved conflict between Bring Out Your Dead and The Choice is Yours on NPC 'Perth'
        -        Forward fixes from USKP to Elemental Staves on Weapon 'Staff of Thunderbolt'

        -        Forward any weapon or armor fixes from WAF over USKP since they do the same thing and WAF has stat changes that need to be present in any
                patch where there is a mod farther down that changes the same record
                -        Few exceptions were made:        -        Blade of Woe, USKP adds MaterialDaedric instead of MaterialEbony
                        (most of these changes                -        Dawnguard Armor and Weapon descriptions were removed so enchantments could be seen and the bonuses are now
                        are also in Core Patch)                        a listed in load screens after starting the DG quest
                                                                                -        DisallowEnchanting added to some items from USKP that were not in WAF, example Wuuthrad

Each of the following three patches forward the changes made by DLC and the unofficial patches v2.0. Use only one of these patches
at a time or they will conflict and defeat the purpose of a patch all together. They have the STEP name on them, but really it just
patches a couple mods with the unofficial patches v2.0. Anyone can use them any way they want without permission.
