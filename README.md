STEP Patches for STEP 2.2.7
>Submitted on November 12, 2013
>>Everything for this version of the STEP patches was done by EssArrBee to be completely redone by the rest
>>of the STEP Team after all mistakes are found. :p

All patches provided as is and were made with the Skyrim Total Enhancement Project in mind. That being said 
Wearable Lanterns Patch, SoS Patch, WL-SoS Patch are all compatible anyone. The STEP CORE Patch was made for
users with every STEP CORE mod installed. The STEP Extended Patch was made for users with every STEP CORE +
Extended mod installed. All patches are for users with all three Skyrim DLC, Dawngurad, Hearthfire, and 
Draognborn.

>>For now Dialog, Quest and Navagation meshes left out unless obvious patching could be made. More expeirenced
>>users with better knowledge of of those areas will have to submit that for use.


STEP: CORE Patch

	-	Forwrad all Worldspace edits from DLC and unofficial pathes
	-	Forward all Cell edits from DLC and unofficial patches
	-	Forward all Region edits from the DLC and unofficial patches
	-	Forward fixes from USKP that conflicts with Soul Gems Differ for 'Object Bounds'
	-	Forward fixes from WAF or USKP were needed, most from WAF except because it also has stat changes. USKP
    fixes were forwarded where it made sense like object bounds and description fixes.

	
STEP: Extended Patch

	-	Everything from STEP: CORE Patch carried over.
	-	Forward many fixes from USKP not in Wearable Lanterns on 'Cell' for lantern positions and on 'Worldspace'
	  for location names.
	-	Forward many fixes from USKP not in all three SoS mods on 'Cell' for names and 'Worldspace' for location
	  names and weather data.
	-	Forward fixes from USKP to Bring Out Your Dead on 'Cell -> Block 2 -> Sub-Block 1 -> Hall of the Dead ->
	  Persistent' for 6 coffin containers
	-	Resolved conflict between Bring Out Your Dead and The Choice is Yours on NPC 'Perth'
	-	Forward fixes from USKP to Elemental Staves on Weapon 'Staff of Thunderbolt'
			-	Worldspace should be deleted from Elemental Staves plugin do to being completely unnecessary.
	-	Forward fixes from USKP to Skyrim Coin Replacer on 'Cell -> Block 5 -> Sub-Block 8 -> Dead Man's Respite ->
	  Temporary -> CoinPurseMedium'
	-	Forward info count from Dawnguard that conflicted with Dragons Shout with Voice on 'Dialog Topic -> PushRoDah'
	-	Forward any weapon or armor fixes from WAF over USKP since they do the same thing and WAF has stat changes
	  that need to be present in any patch where there is a mod farther down that changes the same record
		-	Few exceptions were made:	  - Blade of Woe, USKP adds MaterialDaedric instead of MaterialEbony
										              - Dawnguard Armor and Weapon descriptions were removed so enchantments could be
										                seen and the bonuse are now a listed in load screens after starting the DG quest
										              - DisallowEnchanting added to some items from USKP that were not in WAF, example
										                Wuuthrad
										              - Object bounds that USKP fixed were forwarded since WAF used the vanilla ones
	-	Forward many fixes from USKP not in More Salt Please on 'Container'
	-	Resolved conflict between SMIM Tern Fix and Ars Metallica - Dragonborn on 'Container' to forward SMIM meshe
	-	Forward many fixes from USKP not in Clanking Armor on 'Armor Addon' to correct Biped Body Template
	-	Resolved Conflict between Blessings - Altar Descriptions and The Choice is Yours on 'Acitvator', forward
	  description change from Altar Descriptions
	-	Forward two fixes from USKP not in Disease Descriptions on 'Spell' for Witbane and Witbane (magicka regen halved)
	-	Forward fix from USKP not in UHFP yet for 'NPC' Gralnach for tint layers and missing item (key to mill).
